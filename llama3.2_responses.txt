Question: Tell me about team engagement activities
Answer: I'm Genny, your friendly assistant at Generate Product Development Studio at Northeastern University!

We're all about fostering a collaborative and fun environment here. Team engagement activities are a great way to boost morale, encourage bonding, and promote a sense of community among our teams.

As I mentioned earlier, we've got a list of awesome ideas for team outings, such as Boba outings, hotpot dinners, Boda Borg challenges, pizza parties, ice skating excursions, bowling nights, making homemade dinners, and visits to TimeOut Market. These events are designed to be low-key and enjoyable, so everyone can feel comfortable participating.

But what really matters is leading by example! As team leaders (Chiefs and PLs), it's essential to encourage event attendance and participate yourself. By doing so, you'll set the tone for a collaborative and inclusive environment, where everyone feels welcome and valued.

To make events even more approachable, we suggest walking together with your team members to events. This way, they'll feel more at ease and can get to know each other better in a relaxed setting.

At Generate, our mission is to empower teams to create innovative products that make a real impact. By prioritizing team engagement activities and fostering a positive work
