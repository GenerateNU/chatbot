                resources are effectively allocated and in-line with your needs.\n- If you are a Director, Chief, or Lead, 
                please make sure you also familiarize yourself with Digital Stewardship\n- TO SUBMIT AN ORDER, submit a request 
                through our FinOps Dashboard.\nFAQs:\nWhat are our supported vendors?\nSupported vendors must be used whenever 
                possible. We have tax-free accounts set up with these services and your items will be processed and arrive faster.

                What if I want to place orders from other vendors?\nPlease use custom orders sparingly as they take much more time to set up.
                \nIn some cases, we are not able to order from certain vendors. See “\nHow does tax-exemption work?\n” above for one potential 
                issue.\nBe aware that issues are common with custom orders.\nWhen are orders placed?\nThe Fall 2024 schedule requires all 
                procurement/order requests to be submitted by\n7:30pm every Tuesday and Thursday\nto ensure same-day ordering. Reach out 
                in\n#ops-help\non Slack with any questions in the meantime.\nAny orders not received on time will be submitted at the next 
                scheduled date.\nWhere are orders shipped? Can my order be shipped to me?\nOrders may only be mailed to the Sherman Center. 
                If necessary, orders may be shipped to the relevant lead following approval from Generate’s CFO or Operations Director.
                \nHow does tax-exemption work?\nAs a part of Northeastern University—and therefore the Sherman Center—we are tax-exempt\n.
                \nIf a company is unwilling to remove sales tax, we cannot order from them. No exceptions.\nWhat if I have an urgent order? 
                / I need something ASAP!\nAn order is “urgent” if there is a legitimate, justifiable reason that it absolutely cannot wait 
                to be placed until the next order date. See\nWhen are orders placed?\nIf the need for an urgent order arises, reach out 
                in\n#ops-help\non Slack explaining the situation. Be sure to tag\nboth\nGenerate’s Operations Director and Chief Financial Officer. 
                They will determine whether the urgent order is necessary.\nThe Operations Director and CFO reserve the right to deem orders as 
                urgent or non-urgent in their sole discretion.\nIn most cases, weekend and holiday orders cannot be expedited due to the 
                business nature of most vendors we utilize. Please consider this in your urgent request before reaching out.
                \nHow do I process a return?\nPolicies and timelines vary by vendor. The receiving team is responsible for notifying 
                Operations on Slack (\n#ops-help\n) about the return to obtain the necessary labels. Please provide the original order 
                ID and a description of all items to be returned. The receiving team is responsible for boxing and shipping out 
                the return.\nReimbursements\nGenerally, all morale purchases must be paid for out-of-pocket and then reimbursed.
                \nProject materials should\nnever\nbe bought out-of-pocket.\nKey Takeaways:\n- Reimbursements requests must be submitted 
                within 14 days of purchase.\n- Keep your itemized receipt! Without it, you cannot be reimbursed.\n- Reimbursements over 
                $75 require prior approval from Generate’s CFO or Operations Director, unless morale-related.\n- Failure to do so 
                may result in rejection of your reimbursement request.\n- Pay attention, and triple check your requests. 
                Incomplete, inaccurate, or late submissions may be rejected and non-reimbursable.\n- TO SUBMIT A REIMBURSEMENT, 
                submit a request through our FinOps Dashboard.\nFAQs:\nWhat can be reimbursed?\nMorale\n: Unless otherwise communicated, 
                all\nmorale\nexpenses should be paid out-of-pocket and reimbursed by Generate.\nUrgent Project Materials\n:\nIf approved 
                by your Director\n, urgent project materials\n$75 or less\nmay be purchased out-of-pocket and reimbursed by Generate. 
                Urgent project materials over $75 must be approved by Generate’s CFO or Operations Director.\nAll other project 
                material purchases must flow through our standard procurement policies\n.\nWhat is required?\nReimbursement Requests 
                must…\nbe submitted\nwithin 14 days\nof the purchase.\ninclude a\nPDF\nof an\nitemized receipt\nshowing the vendor name, 
                purchase date, items purchased, total price, and payment method.\nPlease take 2 extra seconds to find a clean and flat 
                surface, take a clear picture, and crop photos to show just the receipt.\nHow long do reimbursements take?\nReimbursement 
                requests take time. They must be processed by Generate, the Sherman Center, and Northeastern University, as well as either 
                the USPS (physical checks are mailed if you don’t have direct deposit set up) or your bank.\nPlease be patient; this process 
                usually takes\n3-4 weeks\n.\nQuestions or Issues?\nReach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack. We’re here to help!"
