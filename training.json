Mockups are shared early and often so that engineering work can begin setting up while design work moves to polishing-focused stages. Even when not included in the designs, it's useful to have discussions of additional user interactions such as animation, hover states, etc. which can be added to components and implemented across the project to \"bring it to life\". Endpoints remain stable in both setup and contents, and mask implementation details, so that changes to the backend do not impact the frontend.

Instead, let them pick tickets which they want to learn from/feel prepared to complete. If nobody wants to pick up a Feature Story/Enabler Ticker, then it either needs to be broken down further, spiked (researched to be broken down), or nobody views it as important and thus you need to sell the importance better or realize it's not valuable (and then cancel it and communicate its cancellation to your client). Empower the talented people you hire and lean on them to make key decisions and guide your project.",

For example, A) \"Make a thing that does this, here's some possible approaches if you're really stuck on where to start\" is markedly better than B) \"Do x y then z\". A describes a desired outcome which the Squad can think critically about how to achieve. B describes an output which requires no complex thought to achieve and stifles autonomy and creativity, as such preventing your team from achieving their full potential.

      "Answer": "Make sure the front-end devs on your team have Figma access. If they do not, collect their emails and either: Give them can view access on Figma. Send the emails to the Chief Designer who will deal with permissions. Once the lofis for a feature are complete, move those screens (and any accompanying prototyping) to a new page titled: Feature Name: lofis. (ShowNxt example: Coach Signup: lofis) This consistent naming convention is important so your devs know where to look for designs! Use the Auto Flow Plug-in to draw connections between screens so your devs will understand the flows better. Let your team know what lofis are ready to dev! Steps for Front-End Development: Once designers let you know a feature is ready for development, open the Figma file (either within the desktop app or in a browser). If the design is ready for development, the designs will be found on the page named: Feature Name: lofis or Feature Name: hifis. This means the designers are done making adjustments to these screens. Navigate to the page you will be developing (using the left side panel)",

Designers should be using components to build out their designs. (A.K.A. symbols in sketch) Definition: Components are elements you can reuse across your designs. They help to create and manage consistent designs across projects. You can create components from any layers or objects you've designed. These could be a whole range of things like buttons, icons, layouts, and more. https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma#:~:text=Components are elements you can,icons%2C layouts%2C and more. In other words: Components are like puzzle pieces. A designer creates components, and reuses them as pieces of the design. If used correctly, developers should be able to create and style the components, and reuse them throughout the development process Useful Video: https://youtu.be/k74IrUNaJVk?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx5LSjOmeBYMuvaa4UayfMe4 ‼  Designers  ‼ If you haven't implemented components yet, it's okay! But it is important for you to transition your designs to be component-based. If you are unsure of how to do this, here are some great resources to use to learn about all things component-based design! Figma.com's resources Figma defines component best practices Introduction to component variants Auto Layout intro video There are so many capabilities built into components!!!! I encourage you to learn more about using auto layout, creating variants, and swapping out components easily. If you struggle with something in Figma, chances are someone has also struggled with the same thing. The internet and figma.com have some really awesome resources to help make your design process more efficient! (P.S. reach out to your Chief Designer with any questions, they would love to help!)",

      "Context": "Over the course of your time in Generate, you will likely need to purchase\nsomething\n. Perhaps a tool for a hardware project, stickers for an engagement event, a subscription for a software client, or catering for a morale event.\nThis guide is designed to help you understand our policies and procedures for making Generate-related purchases. If you have questions, ASK! → `#ops-help` on Slack.\nProcurement / Online Orders\nKey Takeaways:\n- All orders/procurement requests must be submitted via our FinOps Dashboard.\n- Plan ahead and know what items will need to be purchased as soon as possible. See When are orders placed? to ensure your orders are submitted on-time.\n- Routinely connect with your lead to ensure that your team's resources are effectively allocated and in-line with your needs.\n- If you are a Director, Chief, or Lead, please make sure you also familiarize yourself with Digital Stewardship\n- TO SUBMIT AN ORDER, submit a request through our FinOps Dashboard.\nFAQs:\nWhat are our supported vendors?\nSupported vendors must be used whenever possible. We have tax-free accounts set up with these services and your items will be processed and arrive faster.\neBay is no longer a supported vendor.\n4imprint\nAdafruit\nAmazon\nAndyMark\nArduino\nCustom Ink\nDigiKey\nEasyEDA\nEdmund Optics\nFormlabs\nHarbor Freight\nHome Depot\nMcMaster-Carr\nMisumi\nMouser Electronics\nProlabs\nProtolabs\nSendCutSend\nServoCity\nSparkfun\nStepper Online\nSticker Mule\nULINE\nUS Plastics\nVevor\nVex Robotics\nVistaprint\nWaveShare\nXometry\nWhat if I want to place orders from other vendors?\nPlease use custom orders sparingly as they take much more time to set up.\nIn some cases, we are not able to order from certain vendors. See \"\nHow does tax-exemption work?\n\" above for one potential issue.\nBe aware that issues are common with custom orders.\nWhen are orders placed?\nThe Fall 2024 schedule requires all procurement/order requests to be submitted by\n7:30pm every Tuesday and Thursday\nto ensure same-day ordering. Reach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack with any questions in the meantime.\nAny orders not received on time will be submitted at the next scheduled date.\nWhere are orders shipped? Can my order be shipped to me?\nOrders may only be mailed to the Sherman Center. If necessary, orders may be shipped to the relevant lead following approval from Generate's CFO or Operations Director.\nHow does tax-exemption work?\nAs a part of Northeastern University—and therefore the Sherman Center—we are tax-exempt\n.\nIf a company is unwilling to remove sales tax, we cannot order from them. No exceptions.\nWhat if I have an urgent order? / I need something ASAP!\nAn order is \"urgent\" if there is a legitimate, justifiable reason that it absolutely cannot wait to be placed until the next order date. See\nWhen are orders placed?\nIf the need for an urgent order arises, reach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack explaining the situation. Be sure to tag\nboth\nGenerate's Operations Director and Chief Financial Officer. They will determine whether the urgent order is necessary.\nThe Operations Director and CFO reserve the right to deem orders as urgent or non-urgent in their sole discretion.\nIn most cases, weekend and holiday orders cannot be expedited due to the business nature of most vendors we utilize. Please consider this in your urgent request before reaching out.\nHow do I process a return?\nPolicies and timelines vary by vendor. The receiving team is responsible for notifying Operations on Slack (\n#ops-help\n) about the return to obtain the necessary labels. Please provide the original order ID and a description of all items to be returned. The receiving team is responsible for boxing and shipping out the return.\nReimbursements\nGenerally, all morale purchases must be paid for out-of-pocket and then reimbursed.\nProject materials should\nnever\nbe bought out-of-pocket.\nKey Takeaways:\n- Reimbursements requests must be submitted within 14 days of purchase.\n- Keep your itemized receipt! Without it, you cannot be reimbursed.\n- Reimbursements over $75 require prior approval from Generate's CFO or Operations Director, unless morale-related.\n- Failure to do so may result in rejection of your reimbursement request.\n- Pay attention, and triple check your requests. Incomplete, inaccurate, or late submissions may be rejected and non-reimbursable.\n- TO SUBMIT A REIMBURSEMENT, submit a request through our FinOps Dashboard.\nFAQs:\nWhat can be reimbursed?\nMorale\n: Unless otherwise communicated, all\nmorale\nexpenses should be paid out-of-pocket and reimbursed by Generate.\nUrgent Project Materials\n:\nIf approved by your Director\n, urgent project materials\n$75 or less\nmay be purchased out-of-pocket and reimbursed by Generate. Urgent project materials over $75 must be approved by Generate's CFO or Operations Director.\nAll other project material purchases must flow through our standard procurement policies\n.\nWhat is required?\nReimbursement Requests must…\nbe submitted\nwithin 14 days\nof the purchase.\ninclude a\nPDF\nof an\nitemized receipt\nshowing the vendor name, purchase date, items purchased, total price, and payment method.\nPlease take 2 extra seconds to find a clean and flat surface, take a clear picture, and crop photos to show just the receipt.\nHow long do reimbursements take?\nReimbursement requests take time. They must be processed by Generate, the Sherman Center, and Northeastern University, as well as either the USPS (physical checks are mailed if you don't have direct deposit set up) or your bank.\nPlease be patient; this process usually takes\n3-4 weeks\n.\nQuestions or Issues?\nReach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack.

      "Question": "How many 1:1s do I need to have?",
      "Answer": "There are three 1:1s you have throughout the semester. You have your First 1:1, Mid-Semester 1:1. and Final 1:1",
      "Context": "Frequency and Purpose You’ll be meeting with members of your team one-on-one at least three (3) times this semester. Each time, have a conversation with them. There isn’t a checklist to follow or a strict path you must take. Instead, it’s an opportunity to get to know your team members, figure out what they want to do, where they want to grow.  First 1:1 Your first 1:1 should take place within the first two weeks of the semester. There’s a high likelihood that you won’t know most of the members joining your team this semester. Your first 1:1 is a chance for you to sit down and learn a few things about them. This is also your time to talk to them about the project(s) they’ll be working on. Pay attention to which aspects they seem interested in. Here are a few starter questions to consider: Why did they join / re-join Generate? What do they like to do outside of classes and clubs? What parts of the project resonate with them? Also, ask them what their goals for the semester are and write them down. A part of your role as a leader is knowing what people want to work on and giving them assignments that line up with those goals and interests. You want to be the person who is looking out for them and making sure they’re growing and developing the skills they want to hone. These can be personal (confidence), professional (documentation), or technical (engineering).  If they’re new to Generate, give them a tour of the Sherm so they know what the names of the different spaces are! See [Spaces + Reservations](https://www.notion.so/Spaces-Reservations-6051768940a94a63a20f8c7f53ee8d73?pvs=21) for in-depth guide on our spaces Mid-Semester 1:1 No better time to check in with your member than half way through the semester. Hopefully you’ve written down their goals from your first meeting and can check in with them. Ask: Do they feel like they’re building toward those goals? Do they feel connected with their team, their branch, and Generate as a whole? Do they want to keep working on the kind of stuff they’ve been doing? In terms of how they’ve been working with other members, this is a good time to ask them about that! Determine if there any issues they’re facing on the team and if there are better ways you can support them as their lead. This is the only direct feedback that you’ll be able to iterate upon to improve your team dynamics and efficiencies. Take good notes and try to see what you can do to improve your team. If there are any points of improvements for them you wish to share, this is also a good time for them to hear it and have time to improve upon it. Final 1: Your final 1:1 should take place within the last two weeks of the semester. At the end of the semester, you’ll host one last 1:1 with each team member to recap and close out the semester. This is a good time to gather feedback for your successor, to hype up your members about all the work they did, and to give words of wisdom/encouragement/whatever comes to you in the moment. Make sure to incorporate key learnings into your team’s internal handoff document. Revisit each members’ goals, and help them see how they progressed toward and achieved them. Give concrete examples to show your care and help them realize what might be difficult to see. Recognize any shortcomings and emphasize that those are okay. If applicable, offer potential future opportunities to hone the skills they want to refine, gain more experience/exposure, or build on their experience with your team. This could be a recommendation to explore other Generate teams/branches, courses, faculty, external resources, internships/co-ops, research, or events. If genuine, encourage staying in touch. Exchange numbers and connect on LinkedIn if you haven’t already. Consider offering yourself as a resource for future class, co-op, or full-time decisions.",

For Generate-related accounts, please use the official email address generate@northeastern.edu. Do not create any new accounts such as project or team specific Gmail accounts. If access to a service is needed, request credentials from your Director. Provide Operations with all necessary info to create an account by sending a message in #ops-help on Slack. They will create the account and provide you with the credentials via a Proton Pass link. Generate random, strong passwords with Proton pass, using at least 20 characters when able. Do not share account credentials unless necessary for another member to perform their role. Configure token-based 2FA via Proton Pass when possible and save security answers with answers and recovery/backup codes in there. Do not use your personal phone number for 2FA.",

See “\nHow does tax-exemption work?\n” above for one potential issue.\nBe aware that issues are common with custom orders.\nWhen are orders placed?\nThe Fall 2024 schedule requires all procurement/order requests to be submitted by\n7:30pm every Tuesday and Thursday\nto ensure same-day ordering. Reach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack with any questions in the meantime.\nAny orders not received on time will be submitted at the next scheduled date.\nWhere are orders shipped? Can my order be shipped to me?\nOrders may only be mailed to the Sherman Center. If necessary, orders may be shipped to the relevant lead following approval from Generate’s CFO or Operations Director.\nHow does tax-exemption work?\nAs a part of Northeastern University—and therefore the Sherman Center—we are tax-exempt\n.\nIf a company is unwilling to remove sales tax, we cannot order from them. No exceptions.\nWhat if I have an urgent order? / I need something ASAP!\nAn order is “urgent” if there is a legitimate, justifiable reason that it absolutely cannot wait to be placed until the next order date. See\nWhen are orders placed?\nIf the need for an urgent order arises, reach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack explaining the situation. Be sure to tag\nboth\nGenerate’s Operations Director and Chief Financial Officer. They will determine whether the urgent order is necessary.\nThe Operations Director and CFO reserve the right to deem orders as urgent or non-urgent in their sole discretion.\nIn most cases, weekend and holiday orders cannot be expedited due to the business nature of most vendors we utilize. Please consider this in your urgent request before reaching out.\nHow do I process a return?\nPolicies and timelines vary by vendor. The receiving team is responsible for notifying Operations on Slack (\n#ops-help\n) about the return to obtain the necessary labels. Please provide the original order ID and a description of all items to be returned. The receiving team is responsible for boxing and shipping out the return.\nReimbursements\nGenerally, all morale purchases must be paid for out-of-pocket and then reimbursed.\nProject materials should\nnever\nbe bought out-of-pocket.\nKey Takeaways:\n- Reimbursements requests must be submitted within 14 days of purchase.\n- Keep your itemized receipt! Without it, you cannot be reimbursed.\n- Reimbursements over $75 require prior approval from Generate’s CFO or Operations Director, unless morale-related.\n- Failure to do so may result in rejection of your reimbursement request.\n- Pay attention, and triple check your requests. Incomplete, inaccurate, or late submissions may be rejected and non-reimbursable.\n- TO SUBMIT A REIMBURSEMENT, submit a request through our FinOps Dashboard.\nFAQs:\nWhat can be reimbursed?\nMorale\n: Unless otherwise communicated, all\nmorale\nexpenses should be paid out-of-pocket and reimbursed by Generate.\nUrgent Project Materials\n:\nIf approved by your Director\n, urgent project materials\n$75 or less\nmay be purchased out-of-pocket and reimbursed by Generate. Urgent project materials over $75 must be approved by Generate’s CFO or Operations Director.\nAll other project material purchases must flow through our standard procurement policies\n.\nWhat is required?\nReimbursement Requests must…\nbe submitted\nwithin 14 days\nof the purchase.\ninclude a\nPDF\nof an\nitemized receipt\nshowing the vendor name, purchase date, items purchased, total price, and payment method.\nPlease take 2 extra seconds to find a clean and flat surface, take a clear picture, and crop photos to show just the receipt.\nHow long do reimbursements take?\nReimbursement requests take time. They must be processed by Generate, the Sherman Center, and Northeastern University, as well as either the USPS (physical checks are mailed if you don’t have direct deposit set up) or your bank.\nPlease be patient; this process usually takes\n3-4 weeks\n.\nQuestions or Issues?\nReach out in\n#ops-help\non Slack.

      "Question": "How often should I commit?",
      "Answer": "Product development is all about small, incremental changes. When you commit, a good rule of thumb is a single implemented feature/fixed bug/changes in dependencies, etc. Basically, your commit should be dedicated to one thing, and one thing only. That said, however, committing a change in a single line of comments is probably unnecessary, as that clutters the timeline. Adding a feature that involved a LOT of changes in a single commit is not a good idea either — if such a situation happens, try to break the feature down in smaller parts and work on them incrementally. Before committing, make sure that your code compiles and works!",

This is helpful to keep the PR description short, but should not be the entire description. How was this change tested? Every change should be tested to some extent before asking someone else to look at it. If you tested the change locally, explain how. Maybe your PR includes a bunch of unit tests for new functionality. Maybe your project contains acceptance tests, and you included that. The possibilities are endless, but by including your testing strategy for the reviewer, they won’t need to worry as much about reviewing the code for bugs, and can focus on style, structure, and overall efficiency.",
