Statement


Generate is actively looking to expand and diversify the applicant pool for future semesters. One audience we have not tapped into enough is our physical network. Together, let us take initiative to promote Generate verbally.


What does passively networking look like?


If you find yourself in a conversation with someone looking for club recommendations, driven & growth-oriented circles, or a community of builders, let them know that we exist! Talk about…




Who we are
: the student-led product development studio on campus that takes clients, entrepreneurs from Northeastern’s extended network and the Boston area, and builds their product for them


Opportunities
: Engagement, Hardware, Operations, Software—a place for all majors


Values
: driven, empathetic, growth-oriented, innovative, spirited




Do not worry if you cannot remember all of that! Any non-empty subset of those details is sufficient.


Also, if you find yourself with someone who seems like a great fit for Generate, tell them to apply!


Do NOT force someone to listen to you pitch Generate. The indicators for when it would be a great time are provided above.
