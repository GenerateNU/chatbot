Before any Features are merged from Development â†’ Production they should undergo a 
Design Audit
:




Engineers complete the development of the Feature


Engineers notify the designer and set up a time to Demo and review




Designer and Engineer walk through the completed feature together, alongside the Figma designs, and identify necessary improvements (as required):


â†’ Necessary improvements are noted and added to the Squadâ€™s backlog for the next week


â†’ If an improvement is deemed too time-intensive, the proposed changes can be discussed with Leads, Chiefs, and other team members.






The designer approves the implementation and the feature is merged into Production (assuming it also meets code quality standards).







ðŸ“£ This is a perfect use of Squad meetups in team meetings, or team channels for members to show their work and receive feedback on it. 

Note: if doing this in a team meeting, having a paper trail is a great way to make sure all the feedback is adequately recorded
