# Frequency and Purpose

You‚Äôll be meeting with members of your team one-on-one at least **three (3)** times this semester. Each time, have a conversation with them. There isn‚Äôt a checklist to follow or a strict path you must take. Instead, **it‚Äôs an opportunity to get to know your team members, figure out what they want to do, where they want to grow**. 

## First 1:1

**Your first 1:1 should take place within the first two weeks of the semester.**

There‚Äôs a high likelihood that you won‚Äôt know most of the members joining your team this semester. Your first 1:1 is a chance for you to sit down and learn a few things about them. 

This is also your time to talk to them about the project(s) they‚Äôll be working on. Pay attention to which aspects they seem interested in.

Here are a few starter questions to consider:

- Why did they join / re-join Generate?
- What do they like to do outside of classes and clubs?
- What parts of the project resonate with them?

Also, **ask them what their goals for the semester are** and ***write them down*** üëèüèªüëèüèª. A part of your role as a leader is knowing what people want to work on and giving them assignments that line up with those goals and interests. You want to be the person who is looking out for them and making sure they‚Äôre growing and developing the skills they want to hone. These can be personal (confidence), professional (documentation), or technical (engineering).

**If they‚Äôre new to Generate**, give them a tour of the Sherm so they know what the names of the different spaces are! *See [Spaces + Reservations](Spaces%20+%20Reservations%206051768940a94a63a20f8c7f53ee8d73.md) for in-depth guide on our spaces*

## Mid-Semester 1:1

No better time to check in with your member than half way through the semester. Hopefully you‚Äôve written down their goals from your first meeting and can check in with them. Ask:

- Do they feel like they‚Äôre building toward those goals?
- Do they feel connected with their team, their branch, and Generate as a whole?
- Do they want to keep working on the kind of stuff they‚Äôve been doing?

In terms of how they‚Äôve been working with other members, this is a good time to ask them about that! Determine if there any issues they‚Äôre facing on the team and if there are better ways you can support them as their lead.

This is the only direct feedback that you‚Äôll be able to iterate upon to improve your team dynamics and efficiencies. **Take good notes and try to see what you can do to improve your team.**

If there are any points of improvements for them you wish to share, this is also a good time for them to hear it and have time to improve upon it.

## Final 1:1

**Your final 1:1 should take place within the last two weeks of the semester.**

</aside>

At the end of the semester, you‚Äôll host one last 1:1 with each team member to recap and close out the semester. This is a good time to gather feedback for your successor, to hype up your members about all the work they did, and to give words of wisdom/encouragement/whatever comes to you in the moment. Make sure to incorporate key learnings into your team‚Äôs internal handoff document.

Revisit each members‚Äô goals, and help them see how they progressed toward and achieved them. Give concrete examples to show your care and help them realize what might be difficult to see. Recognize any shortcomings and emphasize that those are okay. If applicable, offer potential future opportunities to hone the skills they want to refine, gain more experience/exposure, or build on their experience with your team. This could be a recommendation to explore other Generate teams/branches, courses, faculty, external resources, internships/co-ops, research, or events.

If genuine, encourage staying in touch. Exchange numbers and connect on LinkedIn if you haven‚Äôt already. Consider offering yourself as a resource for future class, co-op, or full-time decisions.
