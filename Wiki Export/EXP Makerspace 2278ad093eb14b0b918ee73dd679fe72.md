The Sherman Center has an agreement with the **EXP Makerspace** that allows our build teams to purchase materials from their Materials Shop. These purchases are directly billed to Generate and the Sherman Center at the end of each semester.

## Prices

A **price list** is published [here](https://makerspaces.northeastern.edu/create/library/materials-price-list/).

### PLA Material

Until further notice through fall 2024, it is Generate’s understanding that PLA material is **free** when purchased through the EXP Makerspace. Consider making use of this for your projects.
