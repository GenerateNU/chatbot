# Morale Budget

Encouraging a vibrant team culture is essential in creating an environment conducive to work and where members are comfortable with each other and in being themselves. One effective way to achieve this is by utilizing the morale budget **within the initial month.** ***This means discussing and determining a date for morale in your first team meeting***.

Please be mindful of branch and org-wide [Upcoming Events!](Upcoming%20Events!%20447ae3efc67a44f4b217c3c066a37660.md) and ensure your morales do not overlap with them â€” these events serve as opportunities for members to engage within the Generate community.

Whether it's hosting multiple smaller events, or planning one significant gathering, the goal is to transform these occasions into memorable experiences. It's crucial to emphasize that these events should transcend mere conveniencesâ€”aka simply ordering pizza for a team meetingâ€”and instead **be engaging to solicit team bonding**.

## Event Diversity

Diversifying activity types can further enhance team engagement. *Consider options such as **Boba outings, hotpot dinners, Boda Borg challenges, pizza parties, ice skating excursions, bowling nights, making a homemade dinner, and visits to TimeOut Market** (see more below).* 

To ensure these events are well-received, make it a point to discuss potential ideas during your team meetings. In the end, this ***opportunity is designed to be low-stakes and easy going***.

## Attendance

It's vital for team leaders (Chiefs and PLs) to encourage event attendance and lead by example. ***Leading by example by being involved and attending events often proves to be the most effective method for ensuring active participation organization-wide and within teams** while f*ostering a sense of camaraderie.

Discuss the idea of walking together to events with your team members so that they feel more comfortable, especially as this is your first social outing.  

***Don't forget the power of introductions and friendly reminders â€”*** facilitating connections among team members and with members across the organization helps create a more inclusive and tightly-knit culture.
