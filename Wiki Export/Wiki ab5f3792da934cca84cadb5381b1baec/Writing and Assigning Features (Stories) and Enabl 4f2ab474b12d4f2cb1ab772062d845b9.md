When writing Stories/Tickets, describe outcomes instead of prescribing methods. 

For example, A) “Make a thing that does this, here’s some possible approaches if you’re really stuck on where to start” is markedly better than B) “Do x y then z”. A describes a desired outcome which the Squad can think critically about how to achieve. B describes an output which requires no complex thought to achieve and stifles autonomy and creativity, as such preventing your team from achieving their full potential.

When it comes to allocating work, do not assign specific people specific tickets. Instead, let them pick tickets which they want to learn from/feel prepared to complete. 

If nobody wants to pick up a Feature Story/Enabler Ticker, then it either needs to be broken down further, spiked (researched to be broken down), or nobody views it as important and thus you need to sell the importance better or realize it’s not valuable (and then cancel it and communicate its cancellation to your client)

Empower the talented people you hire and lean on them to make key decisions and guide your project.
