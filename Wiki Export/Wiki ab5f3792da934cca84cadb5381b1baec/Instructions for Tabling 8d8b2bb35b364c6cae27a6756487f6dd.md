*If you are the first person tabling at a club fair or similar event, **you are responsible for bringing the tabling materials below to the event** — if you are this person, this information will be communicated you.*

1. Begin by picking up materials in Big Studio:

2. Take these materials to the designated tabling location. A table should be provided to you. If there is no table, please reach out to @Chirag Chadha on Slack.

***Once you arrive at the table:***

1. Place the **tablecloth** over our assigned table
2. Set up the **retractable banner** *(see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozGbg9krA5U) for a visual explanation)*:
    
    <aside>
    ⚠️ Be careful not to damage the base or the banner itself. It is **VERY** delicate— if you take it out too quickly it may rip. Similarly, when putting the banner back into the base, ensure that it is properly aligned otherwise it won’t fit properly.
    
    </aside>
    
    1. **Prepare the base**: Place the base on a flat surface. 
    2. **Adjust the feet**: Twist the feet so they are perpendicular to the base. 
    3. **Extend the pole**: Take the pole out of its case and extend it to its full length. 
    4. **Insert the pole**: Put the pole into the hole in the base. 
    5. **Pull up the banner**: Gently pull the banner up from the base using the top bar. Be careful not to smudge, rip, bend, or crease the banner itself.
    6. **Attach the banner**: Attach the banner to the top of the pole using the hook
    7. **Adjust for stability**: Make sure the banner is taut and stands straight.
3. Prop up the **poster boards** against something and place them on either ends of the table. 
4. That’s it! Good luck tabling :)

## Take Down

1. Begin by putting the **retractable banner** back into its base *(see [video](https://youtu.be/fsp4t49oWfk?si=8GL_ZiU-q7sPEuvI&t=36) for visual explanation):*
    1. Place your foot on the base and secure it in place.
    2. Place your hand at the top of the banner and unhook/unlatch it.
    3. Slowly bring down the banner back to the base. Mind the edges.
    4. Disassemble the pole.
    5. Rotate the feet so they’re parallel with the base and can fit into the carrying case.
    6. Place the base followed by the poles *(on top)* in the black carrying case.
2. Remove any materials from the table and **neatly fold the table cloth**. Be sure to place it back into the bin it was originally in.
3. Confirm you have all items:
    
    *Item List*
    
    1. 2x Poster Boards
    2. 1x Retractable Banner + Stand (in black carrying case)
    3. 1x Black Bin with Tablecloth *(see bottom right of image)*
4. Return all items to **Big Studio One (HA-010A)** where they were **originally found** *(see picture below)*
