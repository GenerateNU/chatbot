## Overview

This Spring, we are introducing the Flexible Spending Pool (FSP) which will be applied to all expenses, excluding hardware project materials and standard team morale expenses. 

By implementing zero-based budgeting, we aim to:

- Optimize Resource Allocation
- Enhance transparency and predictability in budgeting decisions
- Ensure spending aligns with Generate’s missions and values

1. **Identify Team Goals**: Teams should identify their goals at the start of the semester and routinely track and evaluate their effectiveness.
2. **Anticipate Expenses**: Expenses must be proposed **AT LEAST** 10 days in advance. Expense proposals can be submitted through this form: [**Expense Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFJHEE40j41X93_qsC7Xudgagn7WOwYMytUZUbcPG_fqN33w/viewform).** This form can also be found in the sidebar of the FinOps Dashboard under “Quicklinks”.
3. **Proposal Review**: Proposals will then be evaluated against a predefined set of evaluation criteria within one week, during weekly Procurement meetings: Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
4. **Final Decision and Tracking**: A final approval, approval with modification, or rejection will be communicated via Slack.
