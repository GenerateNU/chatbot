If you notice a keycard reader isnâ€™t working, ***please let someone know*** so we can diagnose the issue and quickly resolve it. A few things to try to help escalate â€¦ 

1. Understand if itâ€™s an issue with **your** **access**, or with **everyoneâ€™s** **access**:
    1. If itâ€™s an issue with your access, please log into the [Generate Ops Dashboard](https://finops.generatenu.com) to check if you have been added to the access list for the spaces. This issue is common at the start of a semester.
        1. If the Dashboard says you have access, but you are experiencing an issue that no one else is, please send a message in [**`#ops-help`**](https://sherman-center.slack.com/channels/ops-help) on Slack. Be sure to mention the space you are trying to access and what behavior you are seeing.
    2. If others also have the issue, and the keycard reader is **not flashing red or green or making a beep when reading a card**, itâ€™s likely the reader is **out of battery**. 
    In this case:
        1. Please send a message in [**`#ops-help`**](https://sherman-center.slack.com/channels/ops-help) on Slack
        2. Additionally, please **submit a work request** [**here**](https://service.northeastern.edu/facilities?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5a565f8187e64d50d9b1dc6d3fbb35f4):
