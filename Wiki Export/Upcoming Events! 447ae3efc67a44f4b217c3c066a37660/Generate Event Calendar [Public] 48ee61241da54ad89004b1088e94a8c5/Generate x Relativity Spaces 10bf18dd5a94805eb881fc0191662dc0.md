Relativity Space is a startup rocket company well known in the industry for launching the first ever 3D printed rocket to space in 2023! Today, Relativity is an industry leader in 3D printing technology and is innovatively building a medium-heavy lift reusable launch vehicle to compete with other industry leaders such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing!

Weâ€™d love to share more about what working at Relativity is like and hopefully meet some students interested in possibly starting their careers/internships at Relativity, helping to literally bring a rocket from ideation to orbit!
