# Google Sheets

In Google Sheets, you can use a Project Tasks table template to note every task that needs to be completed, by whom, and its priority. Then you can filter, slice, and pivot the table however you need. It’s a very flexible solution, and most people on your team have likely used Google Sheets already.

# Trello

Kanban boards are helpful for seeing the status of all tasks for your project at a glance. Trello lets you build a team, assign tasks, and adjust their statuses while also including notes and details about each task in its card. They have a template to get you started, but it’s quite flexible and customizable too once you’ve learned what you need.

# Smartsheet

If just columns and cards don’t provide enough functionality, Smartsheet lets you rollup your data in many different ways— from Gantt charts to outlines to Kanban boards to tables! They have templates to get you started, and you can customize from there!

# Notion

If you want to build from scratch, Notion has all the components you need— and everyone in Generate already has an account! Like Smartsheet, you can create many views based on the same task data.
