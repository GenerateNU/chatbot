Below is a diagram of how teams are set up into multiple streams to complete work for the project. 


Feature Squads are made of at least one designer, one frontend-focused developer, and one backend-focused developer. 


Together, these cross-disciplinary teams complete Stories, written by the PL, (aka Features).


Engineering/Design Chapters are made of either all the engineers or all the designers on a team. 


Together, Chapters work on Enablers, written by the TLs/DL, to complete work which helps the team better complete its work. This can include Brand Identity, Logos, Typography, Figma Component/Swatch setup, on the design side, and CI/CD, linting, automations, system architecture design, etc. on the engineering side.


The goal of this model is to get people to work together better than if each of them worked alone. 


Over management and/or bad management means people do less than they could have alone. 


On the flip-side, “just enough” management means people do their best (and feel their best doing it)
