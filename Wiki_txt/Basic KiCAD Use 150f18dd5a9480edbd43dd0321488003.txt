Intro to KiCad.pdf


The above workshop details some KiCAD basics such as:




What KiCAD is


Important file types within KiCAD (and other eCAD applications)


How to create a KiCAD project


Some basic schematic stuff in KiCAD


Note that the method of downloading component files for use is outdated in the above slideshow


Instead, you can often find models in the Digikey page for a component, which most of the time do not require an account to download


Components on Mouser require an account to download


Accounts are also required for direct downloads from SnapEDA and Ultra Librarian












Make sure to keep all KiCAD files for your project in the /production/ecad directory of the git repository
