If you notice a keycard reader isnâ€™t working, 
please let someone know
 so we can diagnose the issue and quickly resolve it. A few things to try to help escalate â€¦

everyoneâ€™s
 
access
:


If itâ€™s an issue with your access, please log into the 
Generate Ops Dashboard
 to check if you have been added to the access list for the spaces. This issue is common at the start of a semester.


If the Dashboard says you have access, but you are experiencing an issue that no one else is, please send a message in 
#ops-help
 on Slack. Be sure to mention the space you are trying to access and what behavior you are seeing.






If others also have the issue, and the keycard reader is 
not flashing red or green or making a beep when reading a card
, itâ€™s likely the reader is 
out of battery
