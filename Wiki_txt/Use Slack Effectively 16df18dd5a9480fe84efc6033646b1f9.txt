🧵 Use threads for larger discussions







💡

Threads allow us to keep discussions **organized** and **easier to follow** for all stakeholders




🤩 React so people know you read their messages
 — 
have fun with them!






Think of Slack like a groupchat → we’re all here for a good time!




🧠 Organize your sidebar
 — ****this makes it easier to stay on top of messages






📲 Set up notifications for important channels




Your

Use “Save for Later” and “Remind me about this”
 to come back to important discussions that you can’t get to right now
