If asked to table for Generate at an event, please keep in mind the following guidelines:




**Embody Generate's and Sherman Center's values
:** Reference the three values of the Sherman Center: developmental, inclusive, and intentional. Keep in mind the values that each member represents and how our priorities align with the organization and its members.


Know your audience and highlight Generate's impact
: Tailor your pitch to students, potential clients, or partners as appropriate. Be prepared to share key statistics about our projects, members, and community. Emphasize the real-world experience members gain through Generate.


Showcase diversity and inclusivity
: Mention that Generate welcomes students from all 7 undergraduate colleges at Northeastern, with members from 50+ different majors. Discuss both Hardware and Software project varieties, as well as our Operations, Engagement, and Data Solutions opportunities.


Share success stories with enthusiasm
: If you're in HW or SW, have 1-2 client success stories ready, like Hot Date Kitchen, Alia, or Jurni. Let your passion for Generate shine through in your interactions.


Be knowledgeable and humble
: Be ready to discuss Generate's work, but know your limits. If you're unsure about something, offer to connect the person with the appropriate Generate leader.
