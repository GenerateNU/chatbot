The Sherman Center has an agreement with the 
EXP Makerspace
 that allows our build teams to purchase materials from their Materials Shop. These purchases are directly billed to Generate and the Sherman Center at the end of each semester.

PLA Material


Until further notice through fall 2024, it is Generate’s understanding that PLA material is 
free
 when purchased through the EXP Makerspace. Consider making use of this for your projects.




 This has the potential to benefit the Sherman Center, Generate, and our clients. That said, please steward these resources well as if you were purchasing them ordinarily.




Process






Communicate with your Project Lead to approve purchases and track budget expenses.




 We will not receive a final bill until the 
end
 of the semester. Tracking expenses with your team at purchase time is crucial for managing your team’s budget.








When purchasing items, mention that you are purchasing these items on behalf of Generate, part of the Sherman Center.
