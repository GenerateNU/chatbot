(behind the door)








1x Retractable Banner + Stand (in black carrying case)

2x Black Bin

 containing:



🗣


Please let us know if any of the items in this box are running low






Stickers


Business Cards


Pens


Post-its


Generate, Sherman Center, Forge, Venture Co-Op Handouts














Take these materials to the designated tabling location. A table should be provided to you. If there is no table, please reach out to @Chirag Chadha on Slack.






Once you arrive at the table:




Place the 
tablecloth
 over our assigned table




Set up the 
retractable banner
 
(see 
video
 for a visual explanation)
:



⚠️ Be careful not to damage the base or the banner itself. It is 
VERY
 delicate— if you take it out too quickly it may rip. Similarly, when putting the banner back into the base, ensure that it is properly aligned otherwise it won’t fit properly.






Prepare the base
: Place the base on a flat surface. 


Adjust the feet
: Twist the feet so they are perpendicular to the base. 


Extend the pole
: Take the pole out of its case and extend it to its full length. 


Insert the pole
: Put the pole into the hole in the base. 


Pull up the banner
: Gently pull the banner up from the base using the top bar. Be careful not to smudge, rip, bend, or crease the banner itself.


Attach the banner
: Attach the banner to the top of the pole using the hook


Adjust for stability
: Make sure the banner is taut and stands straight.


Prop up the 
poster boards
 against something and place them on either ends of the table. 


That’s it! Good luck tabling :)








Take Down




Begin by putting the 
retractable banner
 back into its base 
(see 
video
 for visual explanation):


Place your foot on the base and secure it in place.


Place your hand at the top of the banner and unhook/unlatch it.


Slowly bring down the banner back to the base. Mind the edges.


Disassemble the pole.


Rotate the feet so they’re parallel with the base and can fit into the carrying case.


Place the base followed by the poles 
(on top)
 in the black carrying case.






Remove any materials from the table and 
neatly fold the table cloth
. Be sure to place it back into the bin it was originally in.




Confirm you have all items:
