Question: Tell me about team engagement activities
Answer:  Team engagement activities at Generate Product Development Studio aim to foster camaraderie and enhance team bonding. These activities can range from casual outings like Boba, hotpot dinners, or pizza parties, to more interactive challenges such as Boda Borg or bowling nights. We also encourage unique experiences like ice skating excursions or visits to TimeOut Market.

To ensure these events are well-received and inclusive, it's essential to discuss potential ideas during team meetings. Team leaders (Chiefs and PLs) play a crucial role in encouraging attendance and leading by example. They can make their team members feel more comfortable by discussing the idea of walking together to events.

In addition to social activities, engagement is also fostered through all-team meetings. These meetings include a bonding activity at the start, followed by priority updates, feature updates, and squad discussions on new features. The focus is on work that contributes to the end product (features), while enablers are tasks that contribute to the team's future ability to complete work effectively.

At Generate, we believe in creating a vibrant and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and engaged. These activities help us achieve that
