morale budget
encouraging a vibrant team culture is essential in creating an environment conducive to work and where members are comfortable with each other and in being themselves one effective way to achieve this is by utilizing the morale budget
within the initial month
this means discussing and determining a date for morale in your first team meeting
please be mindful of branch and orgwide upcoming eventsupcoming20events20447ae3efc67a44f4b217c3c066a37660md and ensure your morales do not overlap with them these events serve as opportunities for members to engage within the generate community
whether its hosting multiple smaller events or planning one significant gathering the goal is to transform these occasions into memorable experiences its crucial to emphasize that these events should transcend mere conveniencesaka simply ordering pizza for a team meetingand instead
be engaging to solicit team bonding
event diversity
diversifying activity types can further enhance team engagement
consider options such as
boba outings hotpot dinners boda borg challenges pizza parties ice skating excursions bowling nights making a homemade dinner and visits to timeout market
see more below
to ensure these events are wellreceived make it a point to discuss potential ideas during your team meetings in the end this
opportunity is designed to be lowstakes and easy going
attendance
its vital for team leaders chiefs and pls to encourage event attendance and lead by example
leading by example by being involved and attending events often proves to be the most effective method for ensuring active participation organizationwide and within teams
while f
ostering a sense of camaraderie
discuss the idea of walking together to events with your team members so that they feel more comfortable especially as this is your first social outing
dont forget the power of introductions and friendly reminders facilitating connections among team members and with members across the organization helps create a more inclusive and tightlyknit culture

intro to git workshoppdf
the above workshop details all of the terminology and commands that youll need to use for git in generate
first make sure you have
git installed and setup on your machine
if you need to clone the remote repository to your machine
if you need to clone the remote repository to your machine
next youll need to clone the remote repo onto your local machine to do that
navigate to the github page for the repo that you want to use
click the green code dropdown button
if you have ssh keys installed and setup click on the ssh tab otherwise keep it on the https tab
copy the link shown
open a terminal window on your computer and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repo
run the following command
jsx
git clone pasteyourlinkhere
assuming no errors show up youve successfully cloned the repo
now to actually use git to track your project
before doing any work make sure that youre on the correct git branch
if youre not
if you dont have the correct branch on your machine
in the terminal run this command to see a list of all braches local and remote
jsx
git branch a
to get a remote branch on your machine to do work run
jsx
git fetch branchname
if you already fetched the branch and just need to switch to it run
jsx
git switch branchname
whenever you make a significant change to a file code schematic or layout youll want to commit those changes to the remote repo to do this
command line
use the following command to check what files have been changed
the names of changed files will be shown in red
jsx
git status
to add a file to the staging area this is the area that tells git what files to actually track run
jsx
git add filename
once youve added all of the files that you want to the staging area run
jsx
git commit m type a nice message here describing what was changed and why
then type the following command to push your changes to the remote repo
jsx
git push
github desktop
make sure that you only select the files that are important for everyone to have a copy of
write a message in the box at the bottom lefthand corner of the app and then hit the commit button

changes other members of the team can make which impact
frontendfocused developers
a component library is built into a figma page since it makes it simpler to translate designs to implementation
mockups are shared early and often so that engineering work can begin setting up while design work moves to polishingfocused stages
even when not included in the designs its useful to have discussions of additional user interactions such as animation hover states etc which can be added to components and implemented across the project to bring it to life
endpoints remain stable in both setup and contents and mask implementation details so that changes to the backend do not impact the frontend
types where possible are shared across the codebase to remove complexity and need for duplication of work

generate holds a number of accounts that weve accumulated over the years these should be used whenever possible
creating new accounts
be timely
if you know you will need an account request it as soon as possible dont wait until youre ready to begin work with it this may block your team and slow down progress
avoid duplication
before creating any new account ask yourself
is there an existing account or service that can fulfill this need
can we expand the use of a current service instead of creating a new one
if creating a new account is absolutely necessary be sure to follow the principles described below
digital stewardship principles

components
component usage is very important for both efficient design and development practices designers should be using components to build out their designs
aka symbols in sketch
definition
components are elements you can reuse across your designs they help to create and manage consistent designs across projects you can create components from any layers or objects youve designed these could be a whole range of things like buttons icons layouts and more
httpshelpfigmacomhcenusarticles360038662654guidetocomponentsinfigmatextcomponents are elements you canicons2c layouts2c and more
in other words components are like puzzle pieces a designer creates components and reuses them as pieces of the design if used correctly developers should be able to create and style the components and reuse them throughout the development process

this spring we are introducing the flexible spending pool fsp which will be applied to all expenses excluding hardware project materials and standard team morale expenses
by implementing zerobased budgeting we aim to
optimize resource allocation
enhance transparency and predictability in budgeting decisions
ensure spending aligns with generates missions and values
timelineprocess
identify team goals
teams should identify their goals at the start of the semester and routinely track and evaluate their effectiveness
anticipate expenses
expenses must be proposed
at least
10 days in advance expense proposals can be submitted through this form
expense proposal form
this form can also be found in the sidebar of the finops dashboard under quicklinks
proposal review
proposals will then be evaluated against a predefined set of evaluation criteria within one week during weekly procurement meetings tuesday and thursday evenings
final decision and tracking
a final approval approval with modification or rejection will be communicated via slack
please note that we are unable to process purchases of gift cards
evaluation criteria
all expense proposals will be evaluated on the following criteria taking into consideration its alignment with

what is git
git is a version control system at a high level one can think of it as a timeline management utility for your codebase all of your code can be backed up in different versions at different time points so that any code modifications are safe and the codebase can be reverted to a specific point if a bug is introduced
note that github gitlab and bitbucket are specific platforms that host code and are based on git
how do i install git
httpswwwloomcomshare4e8ed6bef63a44c4b3710f28605cf515
httpsgitscmcombookenv2gettingstartedinstallinggit
apart from installing git in the system you would need to clone the specific repository you will be working on to your system this repository will be a part of the generatenu organization on github
bash
git init project directory
git clone repo url githostnameusernamereponamegit
you can read how to initiate and clone a repository in details through this link
httpswwwatlassiancomgittutorialssettinguparepository
additionally you could install git as an extension for your respective ide a lot of them also include it outofthebox making the process considerably easier
overall git workflow
httpswwwloomcomshare3585716bb8d04fd193826b92bd78076b
in generate we normally use the
git feature branch
workflow which you can read more about below or with the following link
httpswwwatlassiancomgittutorialscomparingworkflowsfeaturebranchworkflow
we also have this helpful graphic that summarized the workflow
branches
git checkout branch
one of the most important git concept you need to be comfortable with is
branches
a branch is a version of a codebase that started at a specific timepoint from the
original branch
and then the code that follows in that version may
branch off
from the code in the original version
the cool thing about git is that you can have all those version stored at the same time you just need to switch between them to see those versions with the following command
bash
git checkout branch name
there are three main branch types that you will need to understand
main
dev
and
featurex
branches
for a detailed tutorial on git branching check out this page
httpswwwatlassiancomgittutorialsusingbranches
main branch
the
main
branch stores the latest release of the codebase that means that the code stored will likely be used in production or relayed to the client the code that is stored here
must
compile and correspond to the designcoding standards set by the team
main branch will be protected that means that you will not be able to push to the branch directly and the only way that the code in this branch will be updates is through the prs from the dev branch read on for details this ensures the safety of the code in the branch
dev branch
the
dev
branch is used for development often called a staging branch it will contain the latest finished work done by the team including some of the changesfeatures that are not yet ready to be released and published in the
main
branch
when working on a specific ticket you should not be working in the dev branch directly make sure to pull the code from dev and branch off to a featurespecific version of code
feature branches
note that i said branch
es
there may be multiple features branches active at the same time throughout the semester you will be assigned in small teams tickets that ask you to implement a certain feature or fix a certain bug to do so you will branch off
dev
branch and create a new branch that you will be working on when you are done with your featurebug you will open a
pull request
from your feature branch to the
dev
branch so your feature can be merged back into
dev
we use the following naming convention for the branch names
groupticket numberdescription
the
group
is either
feature
if you are implementing a feature
bug
if you are fixing a bug
the
ticket number
is
optional
and you may have one in the ticket tracking system your pl will use
finally the
description
is a few
lowercase
words separated by
hyphens
that briefly describe the feature or a bug you are implementing
some examples
feature10signinscreen
with the ticket number
featuresignoutscreen
without the ticket number
bug15awsintegration
fixing the aws integration refer to ticket 15
avoid undescriptive or long branch names such as bugscreen or feature23addingthesigninscreenwithbetterdesigntothehomepage
commits
git commit m commit message
git commit
is one of the primary functions in git allowing you to record changes made since the last backup point and submit all those changes under a common message explaining the changes made
how often should i commit
product development is all about
small incremental changes
when you commit a good rule of thumb is a single implemented featurefixed bugchanges in dependencies etc basically your commit should be dedicated to one thing and one thing only
that said however committing a change in a single line of comments is probably unnecessary as that clutters the timeline adding a feature that involved a lot of changes in a single commit is not a good idea either if such a situation happens try to break the feature down in smaller parts and work on them incrementally
before committing make sure that your code compiles and works
writing a good commit message
there are many standards used in writing commit messages and at generate we use conventional commits you can read the specifications over here
httpswwwconventionalcommitsorgenv100beta2
also there are many extensions for your favorite ides that automate these commit messages
vscode
httpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemnamevivaxyvscodeconventionalcommits
intellij
httpspluginsjetbrainscomplugin13389conventionalcommit
pushes
git push
a
git push
command submits and stores the version of code stored on your local machine to the
remote
ie the server that hosts the code repository
remember to never directly git push into main and to always push your work at the end of the day so that you dont lose the work youve done to an accident
read more about pushing here
httpswwwatlassiancomgittutorialssyncinggitpush
pull requests code reviews
once you have pushed a change or collection of changes the last step is to get review from your team this is the most important stage of the software lifecycle and it is also the hardest to define rules for in this section we will lay out some general guidelines for creating reviewing and merging pull requests
code reviews are one of the most important parts of the software development lifecycle they give team members the chance to read your code leave comments of varying degrees request changes and ultimately approve the change with a in many professional settings especially those that could have financial implications for the company a teammates approval is legally required before deploying code to production
due to the nature of code reviews the makeup of a team may dictate tweaks on code review best practices this section outlines one way to review code but defer to your tech or project lead for final say
what is the purpose of a pr
a pr is a request to merge some feature code into the
main
branch which effectively releases a new version of the code base prs are helpful for a variety of reasons
keep the team on the same page with changes to their codebase regardless of who the code author is
make it easy to review a new
feature
foster conversation around code changes for everyone to weigh in on and learn from
allow for asynchronous iterations on proposed code changes
when should i open a pr
as soon as you
push
changes to a new branch you should open a pr there are two stages of prs and its important to respect them so that your team knows when its time to look at proposed code
code doesnt have to be perfect to be reviewed get review early and often if you spend hours perfecting your feature before getting any review then pr review exposes a core aspect of the feature needing to change all that polishtime is wasted
draft
pr once you
push
new code you should open a draft pr this lets your team know that
hey im working on this new feature locally but its not ready for review yet
at this point anyone can see the pr but it will not have any requested reviewers
ready for review
pr once the feature is complete and all the
todo
items in the associated ticket are implemented it is time to request review from teammates removing the
draft
prefix from the pr name and selecting relevant team members from the
reviewers
tab on the pr lets them know that the author thinks the code is ready to go to production and would like feedback
how to write a good pr description
when creating a pull request there are a few things to keep in mind
what stage is it in
if the pr is still in progress prefix the pr title with
draft
or
wip
work in progress also create the pr as a
draft pull request
what background info should the reviewer know
maybe you have a diagram of the workflow that this pr implements or a design of the database table that this pr introduces maybe to fully understand and eventually
approve
your change the reviewer should be familiar with an earlier change any resources or information that the author should know about before reading your code changes should be included in the description
what problem does the code change solve
depending on your team you may have a trello card a github issue a jira ticket etc to link to which contains more information on what this change is intended to do this is helpful to keep the pr description short but should not be the entire description
how was this change tested
every change should be tested to some extent before asking someone else to look at it if you tested the change locally explain how maybe your pr includes a bunch of unit tests for new functionality maybe your project contains acceptance tests and you included that the possibilities are endless but by including your testing strategy for the reviewer they wont need to worry as much about reviewing the code for bugs and can focus on style structure and overall efficiency
who should i request review from
defer to instructions from your project lead and technical lead here but typically when you open a pull request you should request review form 2 people your technical lead and whoever has worked most closely with this code if you worked alone or with one person on it and its a new chunk of code maybe request review from whoever was involved in the data design or request review from someone who is working on the same feature in a different part of the stack or the person who will be picking up the next related feature
if you want other eyes on the code or its a particularly interesting feature pr feel free to request review from the software director chief architect using the
code walk request
form
how to review code
when submitting a pr review you will see there are options to
comment
approve
and
request changes
the goal of opening a pr is to get
approval
from your team the goal of reviewing a pr is to read the code and sniff out any aspects of the code that may not be ready for the production environment i like to group my comments in a review into three categories ordered by severity
nit
comments
nit level comments are nit picks they are comments that dont necessarily change the functionality of a piece of code but they may make a suggestion to make it easier to read slightly more efficient or more aligned with the projects style standards typically its up to the pr author on whether or not they want to resolve these comments or ignore them
example nit comments
maybe you find a method name to be misleading so youll leave a
nit
explaining what you expected the method to do vs what the method actually does maybe your project typically names it database tables as singular nouns like
item
and this pr introduces a table with a plural name like
itemprices
so you leave a comment like
nit to stay in line with the rest of this projects tables can we rename
itemprices
to
itemprice
conversational comments
i dont prefix these but these are comments that should definitely be addressed with conversation on the pr sometimes theyre genuine questions sometimes theyre inquiries about design decisions sometimes they are comments that dont block the pr but are more significant than a
nit
example conversational comments
maybe a new pr introduces an
itemprice
table like in the previous example but there are a lot of duplicate columns between this new table and the
item
table depending on the size of your data and the usages of this table its unclear to you why the columns are duplicated so you may leave a comment like
why does
itemprice
duplicate both the
name
and
id
columns from the preexisting
item
table should these ever be different from their corresponding columns in the
item
table
alternatively maybe you noticed the author rewrote a helper function that effectively exists somewhere else in the codebase you may leave a comment pointing them to that function and ask if they could try to use that one to keep the codebase cleaner
blocking
comments
these comments should block the pr from being merged which can be done using the
request changes
button when submitting your review the are comments about changes that you
know
are going to break some code or do not follow the designs that this feature is supposed to implement
example blocking comments
extending the previous example maybe one of the goals with the
itemprice
table is to be able to handle prices in any currency but the
itemprice
table does not have a column for
currency
you may leave a comment like
blocking according to the designs we want to track prices of any currency should the
itemprice
table have a
currency
column or should there be a
todo
comment in the code to add this support later on
additionally maybe you notice a boolean logic error in a function named
isitemoverpriceint price
that returns
thisprice price
instead of
thisprice price
this would be a blocking change because it will return the opposite of what you expect and could lead to some nasty bugs additionally maybe you also suggest the author write a unit test for a certain function that has particularly complicated logic such that future contributors will not accidentally edit the complicated function and break the code
if you open up a pull request and want eyes on it from some more experience engineers within generate request review from the chief architect andor software director using the code walk registration formhttpswwwnotionsocodewalkregistration4973418aa31f44e0991e2125e8dc2a97pvs21 try to do this at least once this semester

branch engagement
tags leadschiefs mustread
frequency and purpose
youll be meeting with members of your team oneonone at least
three 3
times this semester each time have a conversation with them there isnt a checklist to follow or a strict path you must take instead
its an opportunity to get to know your team members figure out what they want to do where they want to grow
first 11
your first 11 should take place within the first two weeks of the semester
theres a high likelihood that you wont know most of the members joining your team this semester your first 11 is a chance for you to sit down and learn a few things about them
this is also your time to talk to them about the projects theyll be working on pay attention to which aspects they seem interested in
here are a few starter questions to consider
why did they join rejoin generate
what do they like to do outside of classes and clubs
what parts of the project resonate with them
also
ask them what their goals for the semester are
and
write them down
a part of your role as a leader is knowing what people want to work on and giving them assignments that line up with those goals and interests you want to be the person who is looking out for them and making sure theyre growing and developing the skills they want to hone these can be personal confidence professional documentation or technical engineering
if theyre new to generate give them a tour of the sherm so they know what the names of the different spaces are see spaces reservationsspaces2020reservations206051768940a94a63a20f8c7f53ee8d73md for indepth guide on our spaces
midsemester 11
no better time to check in with your member than half way through the semester hopefully youve written down their goals from your first meeting and can check in with them ask
do they feel like theyre building toward those goals
do they feel connected with their team their branch and generate as a whole
do they want to keep working on the kind of stuff theyve been doing
in terms of how theyve been working with other members this is a good time to ask them about that determine if there any issues theyre facing on the team and if there are better ways you can support them as their lead
this is the only direct feedback that youll be able to iterate upon to improve your team dynamics and efficiencies
take good notes and try to see what you can do to improve your team
if there are any points of improvements for them you wish to share this is also a good time for them to hear it and have time to improve upon it
final 11
your final 11 should take place within the last two weeks of the semester
at the end of the semester youll host one last 11 with each team member to recap and close out the semester this is a good time to gather feedback for your successor to hype up your members about all the work they did and to give words of wisdomencouragementwhatever comes to you in the moment make sure to incorporate key learnings into your teams internal handoff document
revisit each members goals and help them see how they progressed toward and achieved them give concrete examples to show your care and help them realize what might be difficult to see recognize any shortcomings and emphasize that those are okay if applicable offer potential future opportunities to hone the skills they want to refine gain more experienceexposure or build on their experience with your team this could be a recommendation to explore other generate teamsbranches courses faculty external resources internshipscoops research or events
if genuine encourage staying in touch exchange numbers and connect on linkedin if you havent already consider offering yourself as a resource for future class coop or fulltime decisions

parent page development resources development20resources2014bf18dd5a9480dcb4cbfec87e0cb38bmd
overview
typically any system that requires any sort of controls computing and telemetry will need some sort of microcontroller or system on chip soc these come in a few different form factors with varying levels of customizability this page will focus solely on choosing what form of microcontroller to implement
bare mcu or carrier board
bare mcu
the term baremetal programming refers to programming without any operating system or resources to aid in the running of your program although you gain fast access to register information and memory there arent any safeguards or optimizations in place to aid your program in running
when i refer to a bare mcu i am referring to a microcontroller unit implemented directly on a custom pcb like in the picture below ie you make the pcb and directly slap the chip on there and routeset up all the io of the chip
this reduces form factor incredibly and can result in much lower power draws as well as being able to directly configure the io of the chip to suit your needs however this adds additional complexity in implementation and flashing this is also typically how most professional companies will end up doing it since they have the manpower to drive this additional complexity in development you might also want to weigh the difficulty in manufacturing and try and spec an mcu that is relatively easy to solder ie through drag soldering
carrier board
with microcontroller development boards like an stm32 nucleo board or a teensy 41 shown in pictures below the bare mcu has already been implemented for you and all you need to do is route the io of the board itself the routing of the io can be done through a carrier board
with microcontroller development boards like an stm32 nucleo board or a teensy 41 shown in pictures below the bare mcu has already been implemented for you and all you need to do is route the io of the board itself the routing of the io can be done through a carrier board
these development boards typically have a bunch of safety circuits and other chips onboard to aid development such as an eeprom onboard activity led reset button and maybe even an ic to handle flashing the chip all of that would need to be manually implemented with a bare mcu however you lose out on the configurability have to work with a much larger form factor and usually end up with an overspeced microcontroller board because there are things that you will never need onboard
carrier board for an stm32 dev board using vertical connectors but can just be soldered in place to reduce height at the cost of ease of disassembly

preface
this confluence page is meant to serve as an introductory guide into the creation and manufacturing of pcbs printed circuit boards this guide will show you best practices and guidelines to follow when creating a pcb after completing a schematic
1 introduction
when creating a pcb it is important to follow certain practices to ensure that the final product is reliable functional and safe the pcb manufacturing process typically involves designing the pcb layout selecting components assembling the board and testingvalidating the final product
this step should follow the creationcompletion of a schematic this is to ensure that you can import all the parts needed to meet product specifications
2 design considerations
designing a pcb layout that is optimized for manufacturing and reliability is crucial for the success of a project here are some design considerations to keep in mind
pcb layout guidelines
use standard pcb footprints to ensure compatibility with pcb assembly equipment
minimize the number of vias and keep them away from sensitive components to avoid signal interferencenoise
place decoupling capacitors close to the power pins of their respective components to reduce noise and voltage fluctuations
proper decoupling capacitor placement it is important to also reference a ground plane through something called a via which is a hole to another layer of the board
component selection
choose components that are rated for the desired operating conditions temperature voltage etc
consider the availability and cost of components when selecting them
use components from reputable manufacturers to ensure quality and reliability
thermal management
proper thermal management is essential for components that generate heat such as power amplifiers voltage regulators and microprocessors
consider the use of thermal vias heat sinks and thermal pads to dissipate heat and maintain component temperatures within safe operating limits
emirfi considerations
minimize the length of traces carrying highfrequency signals to reduce electromagnetic interference emi and radiofrequency interference rfi
use shielding techniques such as grounded metal cans or shielding tape to reduce emirfi
dont route traces with 90 degree bends in them
3 assembly process
the assembly process involves soldering the components to the pcb and ensuring that the board is functional and meets the required quality standards
for simpler boards assembly can be done by hand with the engineer soldering all of the components to the board however for more complex boards it becomes much harderimpossible to handsolder certain components in situations like these assembly will be done by an assembly house
soldering techniques
use a highquality solder paste with the correct particle size for the components being soldered
use a consistent and repeatable soldering process to ensure consistent quality
consider the use of solder paste stencils to apply a precise amount of solder paste to each component
quality control
perform inspections either visual or with a dmm to ensure that components are properly aligned and soldered
testing and validation
test the functionality of the board using appropriate test equipment and procedures
perform environmental testing temperature humidity vibration etc to ensure that the board is reliable in a range of conditions
validate that the board meets the required performance specifications
4 pcb stackups and layer considerations
the number of layers in a pcb is a critical consideration that affects the cost performance and manufacturability of the board here are some factors to consider when deciding on the number of layers for your pcb
this is a typical pcb stackup that a fabrication house will send you a stackup will typically include layer thickness as well as the materials that will be used
pcb stackups
a pcb stackup is the arrangement of copper and insulating layers that make up the pcb the stackup is critical for determining the electrical and mechanical properties of the board here are some common stackups
2layer stackup this is the simplest and least expensive stackup it consists of a top layer and a bottom layer separate by an insulating layer this stackup is suitable for simple circuits with few componets and signals
4layer stackup this stackup consists of two signal layers and two powerground planes it provides better signal integrity and emirfi performance than a 2layer stackup and is suitable for more complex circuits with multiple signals and components
6layer stackup this stackup consists of four signal layers and two powerground planes it provides even better signal integrity and emirfi performance than a 4layer stackup making it suitable for highspeed circuits and mixedsignal designs
8layer stackup and above these stackups are used for very highspeed circuits and designs with multiple power domains they can provide even better signal integrity and emirfi performance than a 6layer stackup but they are more expensive
layer considerations
when deciding on the number of layers for your pcb consider the following factors
complexity of the circuit more complex circuits require more layers to accommodate the additional components and signals
signal integrity highspeed signals require controlled impedance routing and multiple layers to reduce signal reflections and crosstalk
power and ground planes multiple power and ground planes can provide better noise immunity and thermal management
size and cost the number of layers in a pcb affects its size and cost more layers increases the size and cost of the board
manufacturing constraints pcb manufacturers may have limitations on the number of layers that they can provide so its important to check with your manufacturer before deciding on the number of layers
different examples of 4 layer stackups
top layer signal layer 2 ground plane layer 3 power plane bottom layer signal this stackup is commonly used for designs that have multiple power domains and require good signal integrity
top layer signal layer 2 power plane layer 3 ground plane bottom layer signal this stackup is commonly used for designs that have high current requirements and require good emi shielding
top layer signal layer 2 ground plane layer 3 signal bottom layer ground plane this stackup is commonly used for designs that require highspeed signal routing and good emi shielding
top layer signal layer 2 ground plane layer 3 signal bottom layer power plane this stackup is commonly used for designs that have mixed analog and digital signals and require good emi shielding
top layer signal layer 2 power plane layer 3 signal bottom layer ground plane this stackup is commonly used for designs that have mixed analog and digital signals and require good power distribution
its important to note that the choice of stackup depends on the specific requirements of the design such as the number of power domains signal speeds and emi considerations
5 ground pours and power planes
ground and power planes are critical components of pcb design providing electrical and thermal stability to the board here are some guidelines for using ground pours and powerground planes in your pcb design
ground pours
a ground pour is a large copper area on the pcb that is connected to the ground net ground pours are used to reduce electromagnetic interference emi and to provide a low impedance path to ground here are some considerations when using ground pours
connect the ground pour to the ground pins of all components on the pcb
keep the ground pour away from highspeed signal traces to avoid interference
use multiple smaller ground pours instead of a single large pour to reduce the risk of a short circuit
if 2layer place ground pours on both sides of the pcb to increase the effectiveness of emi shielding
power planes
power and ground planes are large copper areas on the pcb that are used to provide a low impedance path for power and ground power planes are used to distribute power to the components while ground planes provide a low impedance return path for the current here are some considerations when using power and ground planes
use power and ground planes to reduce electromagnetic interference emi and to provide a low impedance path for current
place the power and ground planes adjacent to each other to reduce the inductance and resistance of the power distribution network
use multiple power and ground planes for designs with multiple power domains or high current requirements
place vias to connect the power and ground planes on different layers of the pcb
consider the thickness and conductivity of the power and ground planes to ensure they can handle the required current
6 vias in pcb design
vias are small platedthrough holes in a pcb that provide a connection between different layers of the board
vias are used to route signals power and ground between different layers of the board here are some considerations when using vias in your pcb design
use smaller vias for highdensity designs to save space on the board
consider the aspect ratio of the via the ratio of the hole diameter to the board thickness to ensure manufacturability
place vias away from highspeed signals to avoid interference
use blind and buried vias to save space on the board and to reduce signal reflections
avoid placing vias too close to pads to prevent solder wicking during assembly
7 general good practice for pcb routing
when routing a pcb there are several good practices to follow to ensure reliable and stable performance here are some guidelines to consider
trace width and clearance
the width of a trace and the clearance between traces and components are critical factors in pcb design the width of a trace determines the amount of current it can carry while the clearance between traces and components determines the risk of a short circuit here are some considerations when setting trace width and clearance
use wider traces for higher current requirements
use narrower traces for signals with lower current requirements to save space on the board
consider the thickness of the copper layers when setting the trace width
use minimum clearance between traces and components to reduce the risk of a short circuit
increase the clearance between highvoltage traces and other components to reduce the risk of electrical arcing
signals routing
signal routing is critical for ensuring reliable and stable performance of the pcb here are some considerations when routing signals
follow the datasheet recommendations for routing highspeed signals to reduce the risk of signal reflections and crosstalk
use differential pairs for highspeed signals to reduce emi and improve signal integrity
route signals away from highvoltage traces and components to reduce the risk of electrical arcing
place decoupling capacitors near the power pins of components to reduce noise and improve stability
by following these good practices and guidelines for pcb routing you can ensure that your design is reliable manufacturable and meets your performance requirements
8 design rule check drc
a design rule check drc is an automated process that checks your pcb design for errors and inconsistencies the drc helps to ensure that your design meets the manufacturing requirements of your pcb manufacturer and that your pcb will function as intended
the drc checks your design against a set of rules that you define these rules can include parameters such as minimum trace width minimum trace spacing minimum drill size and many others the drc will flag any errors or violations of these rules allowing you to correct them before you send your design to the manufacturer
creating a drc in kicad is a straightforward process here are the steps to create a drc
open your pcb design in kicad and click on tools in the menu bar
select design rule checker from the dropdown menu
in the drc window you can define the rules for your design for example you can set minimum trace width minimum trace spacing and minimum drill size
once you have defined your rules click run drc to check your design for errors and violations
the drc will flag any errors or violations of the rules you have defined you can then make the necessary changes to your design to correct these errors
it is important to run a drc before sending your design to the manufacturer this will help to ensure that your design meets the manufacturing requirements of your pcb manufacturer and that your pcb will function as intended running a drc can save you time and money in the long run by catching errors early in the design process
9 getting your pcb manufactured
once you have completed your pcb design the next step is to get it manufactured there are many pcb manufacturers to choose from including online pcb fabs such as jlcpcb pcbway and oshpark here are some steps to follow to get your pcb manufactured
generate gerber files gerber files are the industry standard file format for pcb manufacturing they contain the information needed to produce the pcb including the copper layers solder mask and drill files most pcb design software packages have builtin gerber file generation tools
check your design before submitting your design to the manufacturer its important to doublecheck your design for errors or mistakes check that all the connections are correct that there are no overlapping traces and that the design follows the manufacturers design rules
place an order most pcb manufacturers have an online portal for submitting orders you will need to specify the number of pcbs you need the type of board material the board thickness the number of layers the copper weight and other details
upload your gerber files after placing your order you will need to upload your gerber files to the manufacturers website be sure to include all the necessary files including the drill files and any special instructions or notes
review the design once you have submitted your files the manufacturer will review your design to ensure that it can be manufactured they may contact you if they have any questions or concerns
payment and shipping after your design has been reviewed and approved you will need to pay for the order and provide a shipping address the pcbs will typically be manufactured and shipped within a few days
in addition to gerber files some manufacturers may also require other file formats such as excellon drill files pickandplace files and assembly drawings be sure to check with the manufacturer to confirm which files are required
by following these steps you can get your pcb manufactured and bring your project to life

the board outline layer is used to define the shape and size of the board the board outline is typically a closed polygon that defines the outermost perimeter of the board
mechanical layers
mechanical layers are used to add additional information about the board such as mounting holes cutouts and other mechanical features these layers are typically used to provide additional information to the manufacturer about how the board should be fabricated

parent page development resources development20resources2014bf18dd5a9480dcb4cbfec87e0cb38bmd
there are many different factors to take into consideration when selecting electrical components to put into a project these include
price
the most obvious factor make sure whatever you are buying is in your price range most components tend to be very cheap a few cents per component to a few dollars making it a good idea to buy them in bulk to reduce the amount of money sent on shipping costs more specialized components however can be more expensive ranging up to hundreds of dollars
size
you need to make sure that whatever component you select will fit onto your circuit board if you are buying components for a pcb for example make sure that the pcb is modeled around those components as a general rule the higher power the component is the larger it will be
mounting type
components come with all different kinds of mounting structures such as throughhole surfacemount etc most components you have used so far have likely been throughhole components there are two metal rods emerging from either end of the component that can be plugged into a breadboard or soldered onto a pcb however if youre looking for a cleaner more compact design surfacemounted components could be beneficial to look into for pcbs
lead time
if components are not in stock there will be a timeframe on the page that says lead time this is the amount of time it will take to manufacture and ship out more of these components most components have a lead time of at least a couple of months so if a component is out of stock and has a long lead time it may be more beneficial to try and find another option
power rating
the power rating will dictate how much voltage and current can travel through your component if you need your component to be able to handle 200v dc make sure you look for that if you need your component to be powered by a 12v dc battery make sure you dont choose a component that has a lower maximum voltage rating the power ratings of your components will dictate both what components and what power sources you can use
to find components usually just searching the object you need should suffice ie 50v 10k resistor some good sites to buy components off of include
mouser
digikey
adafruit

what if i want to place orders from other vendors
please use custom orders sparingly as they take much more time to set up
in some cases we are not able to order from certain vendors see
how does taxexemption work
above for one potential issue
be aware that issues are common with custom orders
when are orders placed
the fall 2024 schedule requires all procurementorder requests to be submitted by
730pm every tuesday and thursday
to ensure sameday ordering reach out in
opshelp
on slack with any questions in the meantime
any orders not received on time will be submitted at the next scheduled date
where are orders shipped can my order be shipped to me
orders may only be mailed to the sherman center if necessary orders may be shipped to the relevant lead following approval from generates cfo or operations director
how does taxexemption work
as a part of northeastern universityand therefore the sherman centerwe are taxexempt
if a company is unwilling to remove sales tax we cannot order from them no exceptions
what if i have an urgent order i need something asap
an order is urgent if there is a legitimate justifiable reason that it absolutely cannot wait to be placed until the next order date see
when are orders placed
if the need for an urgent order arises reach out in
opshelp
on slack explaining the situation be sure to tag
both
generates operations director and chief financial officer they will determine whether the urgent order is necessary
the operations director and cfo reserve the right to deem orders as urgent or nonurgent in their sole discretion
in most cases weekend and holiday orders cannot be expedited due to the business nature of most vendors we utilize please consider this in your urgent request before reaching out
how do i process a return
policies and timelines vary by vendor the receiving team is responsible for notifying operations on slack

about the return to obtain the necessary labels please provide the original order id and a description of all items to be returned the receiving team is responsible for boxing and shipping out the return
reimbursements
generally all morale purchases must be paid for outofpocket and then reimbursed
project materials should
never
be bought outofpocket
key takeaways
reimbursements requests must be submitted within 14 days of purchase
keep your itemized receipt without it you cannot be reimbursed
reimbursements over 75 require prior approval from generates cfo or operations director unless moralerelated
failure to do so may result in rejection of your reimbursement request
pay attention and triple check your requests incomplete inaccurate or late submissions may be rejected and nonreimbursable
to submit a reimbursement submit a request through our finops dashboardhttpsfinopsgeneratenucomreimbursementsnew

electricity is really just organized lightning george andrew abrego carlin
preface
this document will show you how to set up your kicad schematic pages to look as professional as possible as well as give you some good design practices when implementing circuitry
keeping your schematic organized
selecting the correct page size
typically when you begin a schematic kicad will open a page that resembles the following
kicad schematics generate with a
size a
page by default which most of the time will be too small to fit a significant amount of circuitry on
we can change this by zooming in on the box in the bottom right of the schematic page and selecting the box related to page size
clicking this box will open a menu where you will be able to alter the page size of the schematic industrystandard schematics are
size b
although in certain situations will go up to
size c or d
make sure to also fill out the issue date revision and title fields
schematic organization
organize your schematic by functionality
organization of power architecture in a kicad schematic
one of the main goals when creating a schematic is to allow other engineers to easily read and understand the work that youve done and interpret from a circuitry standpoint the purpose of each part of the circuit one of the ways that we can do this is by
grouping components by functionality
grouping components by functionality
means organizing your schematic in such a way that all ics and passive components resistors capacitors etc are grouped together popular grouping includes the following
power architecture how your project is powered
this page should include callouts as to how much power is being used and the current draw on each of the power supplies
as we can see from the image above the voltage levels that the ics are regulating are called out explicitly in blue 12v and 33v switching supplies
shown below is another good example of useful notes to include when listing out power architecture
this image shows both usbc power transfer circuitry as well as architecture to regulate voltage pay attention to how the notes in blue and red
call out exactly what the circuit does and what voltage level it is operating at or regulating
control architecture
another common way of organizing a schematic is having differente sections dedicated to different methods of control
examples of this include having anything that is on a shared i2c line or anything that exists as its own architecture such as a microcontroller and associated passive components in their own sections
as we can see from this image the power supply ldo ic mcu and header pins are all placed close to one another and have their nets labeled this helps us to identify which pins go where
reference designators
another important thing to consider when designing a schematic is having clean and consistent labeling for the various components and ics this includes
using proper reference designators for all components here are some of the most common reference designators that you might encounter in generate along with other information that should be visible
r
resistor resistance value
c
capacitor capacitance value and voltage rating
l
inductorferrite bead inductance value and voltage rating
uic
integrated circuit ic u is more common but ic is still acceptable part number and manufacturer
q
transistor part number
j
terminalconnector part number
b
battery part number and voltage rating
d
diode part number
s
switch part number
tp
test point
making sure that reference designators are in visible locations and are not covered by other text or symbols
ground and power lines should be indicated with power flags
ground flags should always point down
power flags should always point up
other important considerations
the following tips are important considerations to take into account when designing schematics but are not large enough to warrant their own sections but are however still crucial to follow when designing a schematic
ensure that every net has a meaningful name also keep net names reasonably short and only use uppercase letters
a net is the connection between the pins of two or more devices
when doing layout the software will use the nets from the schematic to determine which pins on which devices will be allowed to connect to each other
if pins that are supposed to be connected are labeled with different net names the layout software will not allow you to connect the pins together technically you can manually override this but itll still throw an error when checking the layout
this image shows a schematic where every net is named meaning that connections will be made between the pins with the same nets
arrange pins according to function its ok for the schematic symbol for a component not to match exactly with the footprint of the part if it means that the schematic will be neater or easier to understand
direct connections should be used when reasonable ie when drawing lines directly from pintopin wont result in the schematic being harder to understand otherwise use net names to keep the schematic neat and easy to understand
if you are using any chips that utilize i2c for communication with a main microcontroller be sure to call out the specific i2c address that the device uses

below is a diagram of how teams are set up into multiple streams to complete work for the project
feature squads are made of at least one designer one frontendfocused developer and one backendfocused developer
together these crossdisciplinary teams complete stories written by the pl aka features
engineeringdesign chapters are made of either all the engineers or all the designers on a team
together chapters work on enablers written by the tlsdl to complete work which helps the team better complete its work this can include brand identity logos typography figma componentswatch setup on the design side and cicd linting automations system architecture design etc on the engineering side
the goal of this model is to get people to work together better than if each of them worked alone
over management andor bad management means people do less than they could have alone
on the flipside just enough management means people do their best and feel their best doing it

when writing storiestickets describe outcomes instead of prescribing methods
for example a make a thing that does this heres some possible approaches if youre really stuck on where to start is markedly better than b do x y then z a describes a desired outcome which the squad can think critically about how to achieve b describes an output which requires no complex thought to achieve and stifles autonomy and creativity as such preventing your team from achieving their full potential
when it comes to allocating work do not assign specific people specific tickets instead let them pick tickets which they want to learn fromfeel prepared to complete
if nobody wants to pick up a feature storyenabler ticker then it either needs to be broken down further spiked researched to be broken down or nobody views it as important and thus you need to sell the importance better or realize its not valuable and then cancel it and communicate its cancellation to your client
empower the talented people you hire and lean on them to make key decisions and guide your project
